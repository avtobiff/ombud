OMBUD
=====


ASSUMPTIONS
-----------
* Only IPv4
* Well formed client commands are assumed.


DISADVANTAGES
-------------
* Using select(2) doesn't scale that well, being O(fd_max), where fd_max is the
  largest file descriptor.


POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------
* Using epoll(2) or libevent instead. Epoll scales a lot better, O(1), with
  many file descriptors.
* Given time I would have tried libuv, it looks interesting.
