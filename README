OMBUD
=====


ASSUMPTIONS
-----------
* Only IPv4, no special care taken into account regarding IPv6.
* Well formed client commands and connectable services are assumed, malformed
  requests and unconnectable hosts are silently dropped.


DISADVANTAGES
-------------
* Using select(2) doesn't scale that well, being O(fd_max), where fd_max is the
  largest file descriptor.


POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------
* Using epoll(2) or libevent instead. Epoll scales a lot better, O(1), with
  many file descriptors.
* Given time I would have tried libuv, it looks interesting.

* In order to make a more efficient cache hostnames could be resolved to ip
  addresses before they are used as part of the key.
